                    a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be 
                    adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.

                    the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these 
                    minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will 
                    assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board 
                    whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams 
                    from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable 
                    field may be required to play all their games away.
